    <p>
        This journaling method has provided so much clarity in my life and helped me take care of my mental health.
        I hope that it will provide the same for you.

        The journal is divided quarterly for the 2022 year. <br>
        Each day begins with Gratitude section: list 10 things your grateful for, copy affirmation with less dominant hand (Affirmations change with each quarter), and reflections for the day.<br>
        Following the gratitude page are 3 blank pages (morning pages) to be filled each day.<br>
        If you're not familiar with morning pages they are a place where you brain dump your every thought, even if it doesn't make sense.<br>
        There are no rules on what you have to write, but all 4 pages should be filled each day.<br>
        The 1st quarter provides a quote on each morning page to help as filler when starting out.<br>
        The following quarters skip on pages with quotes.
