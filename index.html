              This website serves as a place for me to store my body of work, and since I dabble in many different areas there's quite a bit. By sharing all my work I hope to provide you with enjoyable content/ tools/ resources that you can use or simply enjoy and get a kick out of. You can find my book summaries, quarterly goal journal, coding portfolio, youtube content, and writing resources on this site. Enjoy. ❤
